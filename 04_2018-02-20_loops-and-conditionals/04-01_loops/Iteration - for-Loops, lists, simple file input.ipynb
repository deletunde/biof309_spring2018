Using 'a window' here means that, for a position *i*, with a window size *W*, we include all positions from *i - W/2* through to *i + W/2*. Python allows a simple means to access such a sequence of values from the list, by using *slicing*. In particular, we can specify *two* values, as in **x[i:j]**, as a way to access a *subsequence* of a list, known as a *slice*, which is itself returned as a list, as the following illustrates:"
