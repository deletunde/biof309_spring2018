Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers, biologists, or those without specific knowledge of Python to learn how to program. 
Week by week, we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of computer programming and the Python programming language. 
There will be in-class demonstrations, using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html), and activities to be completed outside of class, using [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), for you to practice and learn at your own pace.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create working Python programs
3. Understand the difference between Python object types (i.e. lists, dicts)
4. Perform data analysis and visualization with Python
5. Use git for version control and collaboration
6. Demonstrate your Python skills with a project


Communication
------------

**Before contacting us**, please check to see if your question has already been answered elsewhere, e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If you cannot find the answer, please make sure to ask your question thoughtfully (https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and provide everything needed to answer e.g. code, error message, dataset, etc.

In general, please use the [course Slack workspace](https://biof309.slack.com) to communicate with classmates and instructors. If you have a course-relevant question or something to share, Slack is simply better than email. In case of personal/private question/concerns, please use Slack direct message (DM).

In case of an emergency, please send a DM on Slack *and* an email.

Logistics

Required Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own laptop to each class.**

*Programing without a computer would be an exceptional feat.*

For the course, we will use the
1. [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

The Anaconda installer will automatically install most of the software we will use during the course, including [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html).

2. [PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

The very nice folks at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) have given us free licenses for the Professional version of PyCharm, the best (in my humble opinion) Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

If you have a .edu email address, please install PyCharm Professional using [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)

If not, a installation link will be distributed to you by email and made available on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com/).

3. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)

The very nice folks at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) have given us access to their awesome Data VisualizationðŸ“Š, Machine LearningðŸ¤–, and Data Science learning materials.
We will discuss the most interesting examples during class and point out others to be reviewed outside of class.

4. [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com)

Thanks to the DataCamp-PluralSight partnership, we can get 6 month access to WebDevelopment, Object-Oriented Programming, and Test-Driven Development learning materials on [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com).

5. [GitHub](https://github.com/)

All of the course materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
Before accessing the [course materials repo](https://github.com/marskar/biof309_spring2018), you should know that
* it is likely to be under constant development throughout the semester and
* you are not expected to work through _everything_ contained therein!

Optional Materials
------------------

[GitHub](https://github.com) is offering some free awesome resources to students, that might be of interest to you, depending on your background: [GitHub student pack](https://education.github.com/pack).


Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We do, however, highly recommend [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion text [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) by Jake Vanderplas. Both of these books are available free on GitHub in Jupyter Notebook form. The code for [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney is also on GitHub but the text is only available in the printed copy of the book. For maximum enjoyment, consider working through the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way (ebook freely available from the author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a [video course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is also available.
* [Think Python (ebook freely available from the author)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) by Allen B. Downey.
* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3 (ebook freely available from the author)](https://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php) by Charles Severance.
* [Python Cookbook](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393/index.html) by David Beazy.
* [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) by Kenneth Reitz andâ€Ž Tanya Schlusser.
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](www.automatetheboringstuff.com) by Al Sweigart.
* [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python) by Andreas Mueller and Sarah Guido.

Grading __assignments__ will be done using the following rubric:

* Program runs, produces correct result, contains useful comments, meaningful variable names, follows coding conventions: A+
* Program runs, produces correct result, contains useful comments: A
* Program runs, produces something close to the correct result: B
* Program runs, does not produce correct result: C
* Program does not run: Incomplete (I)

Grading the __final project__ will be done using the following rubric:

* Project description / Specification

  - Goals unclear, difficulty demonstrating functionality (1-3)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are discussed but difficult to follow (4-6)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are discussed (7-9)
  - Goals for the project and functionality are logically presented and clearly communicated (10-12)

* Documentation

  - Only comments embedded in the code (1-3)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings (4-6)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, additional standalone documentation (7-9)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, extensive standalone documentation with example usage (10-12)

* Readability
  - The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read (1-3)
  - The code is readable, but challenging to understand (4-6)
  - The code is fairly easy to read (7-9)
  - The code is well organized and very easy to read (10-12)

* Reusability

  - The code is not organized for reusability (1-3)
  - Some parts of the code could be reused (4-6)
  - Most of the code could be reused (7-9)
  - Each part of the code, and the whole, could be reused (10-12)

* Performance

  - Program does not run (1-6)
  - Program runs, but does not produce correct output (7-12)
  - Program runs, produces correct output under most conditions (13-18)
  - Program runs, produces correct output with robust error checking (19-24)
