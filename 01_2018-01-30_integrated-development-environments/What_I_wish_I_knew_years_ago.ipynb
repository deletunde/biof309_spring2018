    "Computer time is cheap, humans are expensive, their time is valuable. Given a task, they need to learn to minimize the time spent writing the code. Or given a stretch of time, they need to know how to maximize output. So they need to learn a few best practices to get the most out of their time (these are just some things I’ve learned that I wish someone told me early on):"

    "* Use a style guide. Even if it’s your own made up style guide, just be consistent. Keep a format that makes bugs easy to spot.\n",
    "* Minimize time spent debugging. That means writing code in chunks, where you get total confidence in one chunk before moving on to the next.\n",

    "* People type at about the same rate, codes usually run at about the same speed, people often get the right idea at about the same speed. These things often vary on a time scales of mere minutes. Yet, people vary in how fast they implement successful code on a time scales of hours, days, or even weeks. This is because debugging is your rate limiting factor. Get good at debugging, minimize time spent doing I. Solve your problem today, not two weeks from now.\n",
    "* You’re going to have problems that you try and try to solve for days and make no progress, and then something will budge. Given a stretch of time to work on something, this means your progress is binary: you made headway, or you didn’t. These best practices are a starting point for you, but you (the student) need to figure out for yourself how maximize the frequency of making things budge."
