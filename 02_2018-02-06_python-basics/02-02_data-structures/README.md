# BIOF309 Fall 2017 - Week 4 (Oct 2 2017)


## Plan for today

* Intro and review
* Review Homework
* Data Structures: Lists, Sets, and Tuples
* System arguments and how to use sys.argv

## Homework review

We will look at the the GitHub repos you created and we will finish discussing Homework 1.

## Reading

* Chapter 07 in [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)

## Activity

* [DataCamp - Python Lists](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science/chapter-2-python-lists)

## Homework

1. Use this sequence as your input DNA (**COPY/PASTE THIS DIRECTLY
INTO YOUR FILE**)
  * ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTATTTGCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT
2. Write a program that will print out the GC content (percentage) of this sequence
3. Use typical mathematical functions (+, - , / , \*)
4. Push this program to GitHub

### Homework Pseudo-code:
* Count the number of G's
* Count the number of C's
* Determine the length of the sequence
* Divide the total number of G's and C's vs the length of the sequence
* Report the percentage of the GC content

For extra credit, demonstrate the functionality of your program at the command line by running the program as a system command with the DNA sequence as an argument.

## Next week

Next week, we will not have class because of Columbus Day. Take the time to recharge catch up on the material, and/or work on the homework. When we return on October 16th 2017, we will cover Loops.
